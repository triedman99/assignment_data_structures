# assignment_data_structures
Buckets and buckets of data!

[A Ruby-based data structures assignment for the Viking Code School which uses arrays, hashes, linked lists, structs, graphs and trees](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)

1.  O(1) --simple math to access exact memory location, time won't change with size of data
2.  O(n) --array must be rebuilt to do that
3.  O(n) --low level language needing to rebuild whole array
4.  O(n) --whole string must be gone through, duration directly proportional to length of string
5.  O(n) --same as above
6.  O(n) --must iterate through each item
7.  O(n) --might require checking whole array. lucky if it doesn't
8.  O(n^2) --each item must be sorted through and compared to previous max value
9.  O(n) --each char in string must be gone through to turn into array
10.  O(1) or O(n) --depends on specific hash implementation
11.  O(n) --at the very least, each bucket must be searched
